## Dataset Content
* Project Example Idea 4: Online Retail Transaction Analysis
Data source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abhishekrp1517/online-retail-transactions-dataset 







## Business Requirements
* Data analysis goals: Analyse online retail transaction data to understand customer behaviour, identify popular products, and optimise pricing and marketing strategies. Provide insights into customer behaviour, popular products, and pricing strategies to improve sales and marketing efforts.
Context
The "Online Retail Transaction" dataset contains information on customer transactions made through an online retail platform. It includes data on products purchased, quantities, transaction dates and times, prices, customer identifiers, and customer locations. This dataset can be used to analyse customer behaviour and preferences, identify popular products, and optimise pricing and marketing strategies.


## Hypothesis and how to validate?
* Hypothesis: Customers who purchase more frequently tend to spend more per transaction.
* Validation:   Perform a correlation analysis between purchase frequency and average transaction value. Use statistical tests to determine if the relationship is significant. Visualise the data using scatter plots to illustrate the relationship.      



## Project Plan

### Objectives
* Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
* Identify sales trends over time.
* Understand customer purchasing behavior.
* Discover top-performing products and countries.
### Extract
* Extract data from the dataset using pandas.
### Transformation
* Clean the data by handling missing values and removing duplicates.
* Encode categorical variables and create new features such as total transaction value.
* Aggregate data to the desired level (e.g., daily, monthly) for analysis.
* Convert Date columns to proper datetime formats.
* Create Sales = Unit price * Quantity
### Load
Store and cleaned and transformed data in a suitable format (e.g., CSV, database) for analysis.

Build visualizations to communicate findings effectively.

## The rationale to map the business requirements to the Data Visualisations
* List your business requirements and a rationale to map them to the Data Visualisations

## Analysis techniques used
* List the data analysis methods used and explain limitations or alternative approaches.
* How did you structure the data analysis techniques. Justify your response.
* Did the data limit you, and did you use an alternative approach to meet these challenges?
* How did you use generative AI tools to help with ideation, design thinking and code optimisation?

I used generative AI tools to brainstorm ideas for data visualizations and to optimize code snippets for data processing tasks. These tools helped me quickly iterate on design concepts and improve the efficiency of my code.

## Unfixed Bugs
* Please mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a significant variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation are not valid reasons to leave bugs unfixed.
* Did you recognise gaps in your knowledge, and how did you address them?
* If applicable, include evidence of feedback received (from peers or instructors) and how it improved your approach or understanding.

## Development Roadmap
* What challenges did you face, and what strategies were used to overcome these challenges?
* What new skills or tools do you plan to learn next based on your project experience? 



## Main Data Analysis Libraries
* Here you should list the libraries you used in the project and provide an example(s) of how you used these libraries.


## Credits 

* In this section, you need to reference where you got your content, media and extra help from. It is common practice to use code from other repositories and tutorials, however, it is important to be very specific about these sources to avoid plagiarism. 
* You can break the credits section up into Content and Media, depending on what you have included in your project.
